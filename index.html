  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>preheat oven to 400 degrees F</li>
    <li>season your steak with your choice of seasoing. I typically use my favorite, Cali Blackened Rub by Kinder's</li>
    <li>after your oven is preheated to 400F, get a tray and and a grid tray and place the grid tray on top of the tray</li>
    <li>place your steak on the grid tray and put in the oven for 20 mins for medium rare</li>
    <li>once your timer is over, heat up your pan to medium heat and place your steaks in the pan </li>
    <li>the goal is to get a crust on each side since the steak is cooked internally so each side on the pan should be no longer than 20-30 seconds. If it takes longer ur pan isn't hot enough</li>
    <li>put ur butter in ur pan and start putting the melted butter on the steak</li>
    <li>take steak out of pan and rest for 2-5 mins and enjoy :)</li>
  </ul>
